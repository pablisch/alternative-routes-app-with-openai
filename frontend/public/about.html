        <h2>
          The Alternative Routes App (v.1) is a playful experimentation app incorporating the OpenAI API to generate new station names for a chosen London Underground line.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          It uses a MongoDB database to store the custom station names along with the themes that were used to generate them. Currently this does not use user accounts and so everyone sees the latest edits rather than only what they have entered. This is managed in such a way that you will not see any changes made by other users until you refresh the page.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Eventually, this app may be used in conjunction with the London Undergorund Orchestra generative music app developed by myself and a small group of fellow full stack developers as the final stage of our Makers Academy software development bootcamp.
